# WeatherShopper-Automation

# Project based learning created by the Qxf2 team.
The [Qxf2](https://qxf2.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=Weather%20shopper) Team created a web application to help testers learn Selenium and practice a programming language simultaneously. You can visit http://weathershopper.pythonanywhere.com. Each page will have an 'i' icon that you can click and read the task you need to complete.
