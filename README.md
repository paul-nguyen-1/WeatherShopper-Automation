# WeatherShopper-Automation

# Project based learning created by the Qxf2 team.
The [Qxf2](https://qxf2.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=Weather%20shopper) Team created a web application to help testers learn Selenium and practice a programming language simultaneously. You can visit http://weathershopper.pythonanywhere.com. Each page will have an 'i' icon that you can click and read the task you need to complete.

# Objectives using Selenium
 a) Scraping text 
 b) Button click 
 c) Wrestle with writing robust locators 
 d) Fill input fields e) Look for form validation 
 f) Handle multiple paths to a button click 
 g) Keep track of dynamic data (e.g.: items change every time page is loaded) 
 h) Waiting for form submission
  
# Objectives programming
a) if-else 
b) typecast scraped data 
c) loop through elements 
d) write code to identify the minimum e) substring search 
f) write good methods 
g) simple arithmetic operations (sum of) 
h) assert correctness 
i) work with 2-D arrays to construct a good locator
